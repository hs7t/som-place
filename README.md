# Supremely Uncomfortable Place (70)

Supremely Uncomfortable Place is one of the scenes in the [Summer Of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com/) [Grand Survey Expedition](https://summer.hackclub.com/s), a collaborative point and click game.

## Whatâ€™s there?
- meet Rob, an awkward rock!
- hear the elevator sound and the really annoying music!
- see my terrible pixel art!
- be amazed at how my spaghetti manages to work!

## Running

Running this scene is pretty simple. It's written in extremely wonky static HTML/CSS/JS. To run it locally, you just need the source and an HTTP server!

### Clone this repo

As you heard it!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hs7t/som-place.git
cd som-place
```

### Start it up!

This is my favourite way, but you can really do anything.

```bash
npx http-server .
```
